# CSPgen
CSPgen is a Content Security Policy ([link](http://content-security-policy.com/)) generator written in Python. It uses [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) profiles as input and generates ready-to-use CSP headers. Additionally, CSPgen can parse a target URL and attempt to semi-automatically generate CSP profiles and headers (WIP).
